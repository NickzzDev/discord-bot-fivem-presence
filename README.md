# discord-bot-fivem-presence
Allows the Bots Status/Presence to show player count from a FiveM Server.

As far as I am aware, this should work on discord.js v12, but it definitely works on discord.js v13 as i have tried it myself.

you need to install the fivereborn-query dependecy to allow this to work by doing `npm i fivereborn-query`.

Hope you enjoy this code!
